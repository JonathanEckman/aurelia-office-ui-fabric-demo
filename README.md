## Building The Code

To build the code and run the project, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. Install [Aurelia CLI](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/framework/latest/the-aurelia-cli/1). Execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install aurelia-cli -g
  ```
3. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
4. To build the code, you can now run:

  ```shell
  au run --watch
  ```
5. You will find the bundled app code in the `wwwroot/scripts` folder.

6. Browse to localhost:9000
